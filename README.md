## **Pre-requisites**
1. Java 11+
### **Lombok**
Since Lombok is used, you need to install the appropriate plugin within your IDE (https://projectlombok.org)
### **Code Style**
For those using Intellij IDEA there is already a formatter included in the Project. If it's not enabled by default you can do that in File->Settings->Editor->Code Style-Scheme->Project.
Also make sure that "Enable EditorConfig support" is checked, this can be found in File->Settings->Editor->Code Style

## **Running the project**
### **Gradle**
```gradlew application:bootRun```
### **Docker**
```docker-compose up```
